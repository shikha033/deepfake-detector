# Deepfake Detector: Deepfake Detection with Web UI

This project is a simple deepfake detection system that uses a pre-trained model and provides a clean web interface to test videos easily. The main goal was to make something that doesn't require training from scratch and can be run locally without much setup.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

DeepDetect allows users to upload a video and check if it's real or fake using a trained deep learning model. It uses **CNN + LSTM** under the hood and processes video frames to detect manipulations. The interface is built using **HTML, CSS**, and **Flask**.
